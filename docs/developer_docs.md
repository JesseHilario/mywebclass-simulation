# Developer Instructions
Create easy-to-understand and reliable instructions for installing the project on the developer's Mac or Windows 
computer and add a link to them to your readme.md file.

## System Requirements
* Mac OS X 10.12 or later, or Windows 10
* Pycharm
  * Download Pycharm Community from [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)
* Git
  * Install Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installing the Project locally
To install a project from GitHub using PyCharm, you can follow these steps:

1. Open PyCharm and click on "File" in the top menu bar, then select "New Project".
2. In the "New Project" window, select "Git" from the left-hand menu and enter https://github.com/JesseHilario/mywebclass-simulation.git in the "Clone Repository" field. You can also choose where you want to save the project on your local machine.
3. Click on "Clone" to begin cloning the repository to your local machine. PyCharm will download all of the files from the repository and set up the project.
4. Once the project is cloned, PyCharm will open the project automatically. You can now start working on the project or make changes as needed.

Alternatively, to install through the Pycharm terminal:
  * Clone the project repository: git clone https://github.com/JesseHilario/mywebclass-simulation.git
  * Navigate to the project directory: cd mywebclass-simulation
* To install through Pycharm

If you want to push changes back to the GitHub repository, you can do so directly from PyCharm. Here's how:
1. Open the project in PyCharm and make any changes you want to make.
2. Once you're ready to push your changes back to GitHub, click on "VCS" in the top menu bar and select "Git" from the dropdown menu.
3. Select "Commit..." to open the commit dialog window. Here you can review your changes and enter a commit message to describe the changes you've made.
4. After you've reviewed and entered a commit message, click "Commit" to commit your changes.
5. Once your changes are committed, click on "VCS" again and select "Git" from the dropdown menu.
6. Select "Push" to push your changes to the GitHub repository.

That's it! With these steps, you can clone and work on GitHub projects directly in PyCharm.
