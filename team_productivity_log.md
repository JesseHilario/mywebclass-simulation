# Team Productivity Log

## Sprint 1
Add columns for issue title,story points, issue link, status, assigned to, assigned on, completed on, category, status 
notes. Each time a team member completes a task in the project they need to create an issue on GitHub and add that link 
to this document. Tasks can be the following categories: Feature, Bug, Docs, or Devops Task

*Note: This log will be used to determine project contributions and evaluate if each member made adequate and equal 
contributions to the project.*
